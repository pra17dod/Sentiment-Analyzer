## Project Motivation
The current times have highlighted the increasing negativity in and around our social media network, especially on Youtube. The negative comments on Youtube have often discouraged good content creators to continue posting awesome new content on their channels. Some of these content creators even consider leaving their careers on Youtube due to this. This prevailing negativity and helplessness motivated us to solve the problem for the greater good - A chrome extension that filters out the negative comments on a Youtube video. To do so, we have used Machine Learning as our primary focus.
